# Welcome to Fartopia!  

Don't get your hopes up, because this game really stinks.  
There is not much to look at in Fartopia at this point, but you can be sure to get a laugh by speaking to your friends in Fartese.  Volume up!

Commands:

/fartspeak allows a user ottype a word and then hear it played in fartese.  Each letter of the alphabet was mapped to a fart sound that increases in complexity and juiciness based on the rarity of the letter in the English language.  Check the audio folder to see which letter have longer duration.  

/fartstep allows a user to toggle on and off the endless fart loop.  This is a fart sound that sticks to the player, so you can have some fun when approaching friends in the game.   

If you hold shift while the fartstep loop is playing, the fart sound will increase in pitch.  If you jump, you will hear a little toot.  

Stay tuned for more Hytopia Team.  Although I am still learning to code using the Hytopia SDK, I will always be passionate about farts.
